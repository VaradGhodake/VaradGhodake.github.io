Some of the utilities SREs/Software Developers use include things like ping, traceroute, ipconfig/ip/ifconfig, nslookup, and netsh. One should also learn how and when to use them and how to interpret their outputs. \n\nSections\nBackground\n\nIntroduction to internetworking\n\nInternetworking and internet\n\n\nConnectivity\n\nLANs\nRouters/Layer-3 Switches (physical devices) and Gateways (interface)\nARP protocol: IP (level-3) -> MAC (level-2), default gateways  MAC mapping for destination packet building\n\nEvery machine has a default gateway i.e. a physical devide/IP that can route packets to the destination. This gateway can be a Router or a Layer-3 switch. While creating a destination packet, machine uses ARP protocol to get level-3 device's MAC address. It encapsulates the destination IP and gateway MAC in that packet.\nSame thing happens in reverse-order on the receiving-side\n\n\nFirewalls: for security and NAT-ing\nISP: Customer Premises Equipment (CKE) router and ISP-peering\nThese CKEs (given by ISPs) provide an interface to on-premise firewalls to connect to ISPs. ISPs peer with each other to facilitate the connection.\n\n\nRoot servers and ADNS\nSome huge orgs maintain root DNS servers; while querying a site over the internet, intranet DNS server connects to one of these root servers and queries for the destination address IP. These root servers know what the Authoratative DNS for that external site is. This ADNS then provides the IP address of pertaining service. \n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting methodology\n\nDefining the problem\nIsolate the layer\nIsolate the scope\nIsolate the cause\n\n\n\n\nIsolating the layer\nWe go from the lowest layers (Physical, DLL) to the highest (Network, Transport) since each layer depends on all lower layers. \nNetworking related problems are generally upto transport layer. \nThe last 3, Session, Presentation, Application layers are generally application specific and one needs to have some sort of application implimentation knowledge.\n1. Physical Layer\n\nIs the network cable plugged in?\nDoes the NIC have a link light?\n\n2. Data Link Layer\n\nInitial check: ipconfig/ifconfig to check if ip and netmask are configured properly, ARP won't work otherwise\nIs the problem confined to intranet or spans internet as well?\n\nOther devices on LAN are reachable?\n$ ping \n$ arp -a\n\n\nIs the default gateway reachable? Same step as above with the default/ARP gateway\n\nIf the IP address is wrong, we should get one assigned through DHCP. Some switches are well equipped enough to act as a DHCP server: ifconfig/ipconfig lists the DHCP server.\n3. Network\n\nIs the destination reachable? traceroute, pathping\n\nIPv4\nPossible causes:\n\nWrong IPv4 default gateway\nStatic APR entry; should be dynamic\n\n# delete ARP cache\n$ arp -d\n\nCan also use netsh (Network Shell)\nIPv6\nIPv6 does not use ARP. It uses Neighbor Discovery Protocol; operates in similar pricipal to ARP but we administer it differently.\narp -a equivalent:\n$ netsh\n> interface ipv6\n> show neighbors\n# arp -d\n> delete neighbors\n# disable router discovery (ipv6 feature) if required\n> set interface \"Local Area Network\" routerdiscovery=disabled\n\n4. Transport\n\nPorts come into play in this layer. Check if they are accepting connections on standard/requested ports.\ntelnet, nslookup\n\nPorts dictate what application will be receiving packets. We can reach upto layer-7 if we know the port and most of the times the troubleshooting takes place on the application layer. \nUse telnet to see if the application uses just HTTP instead of HTTPS.\nSSL/TLS toubleshooting\nUse openssl command to glean more information about the certificate \n\nCheck if the certificate is correct (Canonicalized DNS name for Kerberos)\nCheck if the certificate is valid; not expired\nCheck NGINX/Apache (revese proxy) logs and configs\n\nIsolating the scope\n\nHow many users are affected?\nHow long has this problem been going on?\nHave you ever had this problem before?\n\nNetwork slowness\n\nDifferent methods while troubleshooting IPv4 (and ICMPv4 pings) and IPv6 (ICMPv6 pings). Traceroute sends multiple packets, don't be alarmed if some of them time-out.\n\nRun traceroute multiple times, sometimes packets take different routes. This can explain intermittant access. One of the routes can be damaged.\n\n\n"},"TechStuff/docker-podman-net.html":{"url":"TechStuff/docker-podman-net.html","title":"alias docker='podman'","keywords":"","body":"alias docker='podman'\n\n☸️🐋\n\nStumbled across this tweet today:\nI completely forgot that ~2 months ago I set up \"alias docker='podman'\" and it has been a dream. #nobigfatdaemons @projectatomic— Alan Moran ☕️💻 (@ialanmoran) May 30, 2018 \nSeems quite simple and effective, doesn't it? Not exactly. Let's go through some important details, specifically regarding network namespaces that one might miss out.\nBackground\nContainer Networking\nUseful resources: \n\nDocker/Podman official documentations\n Nigel Poulton \n Redhat: Podman rootfull vs rootless networking \n Bride-node networking tutorial  |  Gist \n\nBasics\nComponents:\n\nCNM: Container Network Model\nNetwork model tenets:\n\nSandbox: network namespace\nEndpoint: IP address\nNetwork: binds the ip with host\nIt's the same idea as that of Bridge Networking (discussed below)\n\n\n\nLibnetwork\nImplementation of the design spec i.e. CNM. This library takes care of setting the net namespace.\n\n\n\n\n \nRE: Redhat blog listed above, TL;DR: \nWhen using Podman as a rootless user, the network setup is automatic. Technically, the container itself does not have an IP address, because without root privileges, network device association cannot be achieved. Moreover, pinging from a rootless container does not work because it lacks the CAP_NET_RAW security capability that the ping command requires.\n\nBridge networking\nTools required: ip command\n\n\nCreate a network namespace with ip command\nCreate a veth pair: veth1 and vpeer1\nPush vpeer1 inside the newly created namespace; create loopback lo as well\nAssign IP addresses (make sure you use masking) to both of them and set them UP\nCreate iptable rule inside the namespace to set up routes to loopback and connects vpeer1 and veth1\nEnable forwarding through /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward and iptables rule b/w eth0 and veth1\n\nip command cheatsheet:\n$ ip {netns, link, route} show # show resources\n# Execute commands inside the namespace with:\n$ ip netns exec  \n\n\nA container is a collection of namespaces. Libnetwork takes care of setting up the net namespace. Plugins set up a topology.\nContainer Network:\n\n# list existing network namespaces\n$ docker network ls\n# create a network namespace\n$ docker create network -d bridge brooklyn\n# launch and bind this network to an existing container\n$ docker run -dit --name nyc --network brooklyn alpine sh\n# disconnect this network from the container\n$ docker disconnect brooklyn nyc\n# connect back with connect instead of disconnect\n\nInter-container communication for docker can be achieved as above, it doesn't work for the default bridge, only for newly networks the containers will be able to talk to each other. \nPodman\nThere are some limitations with podman. Because of the dnsname plugin's dependency on dnsmasq: \n This blog  (translated from Japanese) explains it. The fix is to set --disable-dns flag.\nRootless containers need -P to talk through host's networking. Rootfull containers can attach to a user defined bridge and would be able to talk to each other just fine through IP or the container name.\n"},"TechStuff/ksqldb-experiments.html":{"url":"TechStuff/ksqldb-experiments.html","title":"A Very Bad ksqlDB Tutorial","keywords":"","body":"ksqlDB intro: a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad tutorial\n\n🚀🐋\n\nHere's the repo y'all really want https://github.com/VaradGhodake/ksql-demo\ngit clone https://github.com/VaradGhodake/ksql-demo.git\ncd ksql-demo\nLaunch 3 terminals, preferably with TMUX or Windows Terminal for convenience.\nTerminal 1\nBoot up everything\ndocker-compose up -d\ndocker-compose ps\nPull up a shell.
